# raspbian-ovos

<strong>** DEV BRANCH **</strong>

<strong>Images built from this branch are NOT guarenteed to always work.</strong>

Run ovos on top of RaspberryPiOS

Prebuilt images can be found on the [OpenVoiceOS Downloads Page](https://downloads.openvoiceos.com/images/picroft/github/workspace/pi-gen/deploy/)

Check out the [community documentation](https://openvoiceos.github.io/community-docs/raspbian_ovos/) for information on how to install manually or build an image yourself.

Purpose of this guide

This guide was originally designed for a headless, (No GUI) Raspberry Pi 3. The RPi3 does not have the umph required to reliably run ovos-shell, hence "headless". There is not an image avaliable at this point in time that works with this hardware(RPi3), so this was constructed. This guide DOES NOT produce the same experince as the official images do. This just creates a minimal install, that the user can then expand to thier own personal needs.

Please, if any mistakes, including spelling mistakes are found, or if a more detailed explanation of a step is needed, open an issue here and I will address it ASAP.
